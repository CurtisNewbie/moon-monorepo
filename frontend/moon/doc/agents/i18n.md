# I18n Style Guide For Agents

All hardcoded i18n values should be changed to use i18n.service.ts.

Components that need i18n internationalization, should inject `I18n` service.

E.g,.

```ts
import { I18n } from "../i18n.service";

  constructor(
    public i18n: I18n,
    ...
  ) {}
```

Then inside each component, there should be a function that call `this.i18n.trl(..)` for translation, first arg should be name of the component, and the second arg being the key of the translated term.

E.g.,

```ts
  trl(k) {
    return this.i18n.trl("manage-files", k)
  }
```

With `trl(...)` function implemented, inside the component template, rewrite previous hardcoded i18n values with `{{trl('...')}}`.

A good example would be the `access-log.component.ts` in access-log component.

If user asks you to fix all components, be sure to fix 5 components at a time, do not overload your context. No need to rush, correctness is the key.
